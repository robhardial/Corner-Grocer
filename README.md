  This program was created for Corner Grocer to analyze there daily text records of grocery item purchases. The list includes the chronological order of items purchased and they want to use the list to rearrange there produce section. The program has three functions for inputting the .txt file and it can print a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased, number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day, or text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased. I did particularly well with naming variables and input validation. I would improve my code by inserting more in line comments to help others understand the functions. 
  The most challenging part of the code for me was displaying the histogram for items purchased in a given day. I was confused about displaying the stars for each item but overcame by looking back in zybooks to understand I needed to include a loop for outputting stars. The tools I include in my resources are Youtube, Zybooks, and Google. The skills that are particularly transferable from this project is combining C++ and python into single program. The additon of python make creating functions simpler because of the syntax. The program is maintable because it's clear to understand and include comments.
